      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <header>What you should already know</header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } 
          greetMe("World");</code>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>
    </section>
    <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example, </p>
      <code>var x = 42.</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example, </p>
      <code>x = 42</code>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <code>let y = 42</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="variable_scope" class="main-section">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. </p>
      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
    </section>
    <section id="constants" class="main-section">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
      <code>const PI = 3.14</code>
      <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
      <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
      <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example: </p>
      <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
      CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
      }</code>
      <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
      <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
    </section>
    <section id="data_types" class="main-section">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
          <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
          <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
          <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159</li>
          <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
          <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>and object.</li>
      </ul>
